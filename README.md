# AI-driven-Snake-Game
In this project, I've trained a simple snake game we all have played in our child using **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Q-Learning**.
1. Implemented a Snake game using PyGame
2. Trained it using Pytorch.
3. Used Reinforcement Learning and **Feed-forward Neural network**
